Enticed by the offer, I installed the app and proceeded through the setup process. However, upon reaching the final step to redeem the free lifetime access, I encountered a significant issue: a banner obscured the submit button, rendering it unclickable. This obstruction prevented me from completing the redemption process. Ôøº Ôøº\n\nSubsequently, I discovered that instead of receiving the promised free lifetime access, I was enrolled in a yearly subscription costing $14.99. This unexpected charge felt deceptive and manipulative. The developers‚Äô decision to obscure the redemption button suggests a deliberate attempt to funnel users into a paid subscription under the guise of a free offer. Ôøº\n\nIn response to this experience, I have removed my payment information from my iTunes Apple ID to prevent any further unauthorized charges. This incident has left me feeling frustrated and disillusioned, as I have never encountered such tactics with any other app.\n\nI strongly advise potential users to exercise caution before downloading this app. The developers appear to prioritize their financial gain over user trust and transparency. Such practices undermine the integrity of promotional offers and erode user confidence.\n\nRating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",

However, the description offers minimal insight. \n\nIt does not photograph when you unlock your phone, it photographs when you open this app. So you must leave it in the foreground when you lock your phone for it to work. \n\nAdditionally, there is a delay, and I tested it; if you swipe out of the app before it manages to capture, you bypass the photograph and nothing is recorded. \n\nAlso, the passcode sound alert is when THIS app‚Äôs custom entry passcode is typed wrong - not when your phone‚Äôs lock screen passcode is typed wrong.\n\nThere are no instructions for use to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything, and very few customization features to toy with. I‚Äôm sure that actually capturing a photo upon unlock by a third party app does not fall within the security parameters by Apple. However, I believe there could still be some creative workarounds to eloquently trigger a log more quickly and efficiently without being too intrusive. \n\nI would love to see two things; an iCloud sync so I can check the log from another device in case it is stolen, as well as an improvement in the activity log UI. I have to click the trash can to delete one photo at a time, and type my passcode each time. Why is there no select box or ‚Äòselect all‚Äô button?",
