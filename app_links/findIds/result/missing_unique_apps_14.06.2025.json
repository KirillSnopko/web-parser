If there are no sessions, it should at least categorize each task type together (or there should be an option for this). This app has nothing! It also tries to scam you into spending $14, and if you don’t buy it, the payment interface keeps popping up. It also constantly pops up a rating page, asking me to give it 5 stars.

This isn’t great for people who take longer to read in any language, this is especially difficult if the language isn’t using the latin alphabet. I’m learning Russian, so i’m having to remember a whole new alphabet, read and process it quickly, i’m a native english speaker and i can’t even do that with english! At least when i came into this i already knew the alphabet because i’m using this to supplement my duolingo lessons as well. I also find it very unfair that people at a much higher level, using the fluency pass can be matched with you in PvP. 90% of the questions i am left guessing on.\n\nI’m not going to give up on playing, but thats my two cents on it.

That being said, it’s unfortunate that I don’t quite feel that this individual issue was quite worth $1.99, but I also know that a lot of effort went into the comic; so because the money will go on to support more comics, I can live with the price tag.\n\nOn that note, I still plan to buy the next issue.

I would prefer it to just draw a line to the correct place and tell me how far off I was with my guess. I think it could be improved with some gamification.

At best, this app is better suited for TestFlight release… allowing the dev to refine the app whilst avoiding negative reviews. \n\nThe UI/UX and functionality of this app is on par with heart rate checking app from 2015 with AI functionality added. Which AI language model(s)… good, accurate, credible, up to date, fine-tuning tested/refined??  Who knows… They don’t tell you. \n\nThe vast majority of AI apps that have flooded the market over the past two years follow a similar trend… add ‘AI’ functions from an anonymous or ambiguously defined LLM to a half-baked or poorly conceived UI/UX. \n\n2-stars because it’s an indie dev. Otherwise, it 1. Honestly, any dev that will take the time to nail UI/UX first and clearly and honestly outline all aspects of the AI model powering the app (LLM, version, fine-tuning, testing, etc) will distinguish themselves from the masses.",

My biggest problem is with the app's random number generator. It isn't so random. The, \"opponent\" will get multiple rolls within a turn, but, \"Player 1\" rarely does. Many times I've removed all but one piece when the app has removed only one or two and, because of the, \"luck\" of the rolls, I end up losing. Another thing that's upsetting is that, having lost a game, the app IMMEDIATELY tells me I'm a, \"LOSER\". But, on the rare occasions I've won, it takes its own sweet time telling me I've won. I would love to see these issues addressed, but I doubt I ever will, because I removed this app from ALL my devices. Also, take not of the developers' responses to reviews:  they're always the same, and NEVER to a less than stellar review.  What an arrogant attitude.  Good luck.",

Once deleted it is gone forever. \n\nOn Screen Time access, the developer can issue a prompt that some features of the app will not function correctly without access but forcing the end user into an endless loop prompt until you agree to give it access does not inspire confidence or trust, it’s just sloppy coding and testing.",

I store my recipes on Zotero and don’t want to have to do fiddly photo stitching to get an image I can attach to my files. \n\nFourth— the second recipe I found was missing crucial information. The first step was to prepare the caramelized nuts, and from the way it was set up, I was to add every ingredient to the nuts, including lettuce, cheese, oil, water, etc. Luckily, I found out I could click on the author's name and go to her site to find out what she really meant. \n\nFifth— this is a pie-in-the-sky wish. People don't seem to understand how to compose recipes, and I'd love to see this app or any other provide tutorials. Recipes have traditionally been written with a standard and succinct vocabulary, but, oh my! The things I see online! In the aforementioned recipe, I was instructed to “make the nuts” rather than “prepare” the nuts. I suppose it sounds unimportant to anyone who has found most of their recipes online, but it irritates me. There are so many annoying extras- who needs to be told the first part is the “ingredients “ and the second is “how to make,” “instructions for cooking,” and the many dozens of other ways to clutter things up. The individual steps have just as much excess verbiage. I’ve been cooking since I was about 9 or 10 years old and am old enough to remember Nixon’s resignation and his election. I don't need or want excess stuff in my recipes, so I too often need to rewrite them to make sense.

If an app is promoted as free, it should not lock all features behind a subscription right from the start.\n\nI hope the developers address this and make the terms clearer.

You can have AI create you a workout plan based upon what equipment you have at home. However, I did not say I had a barbell at home and every routine it created included barbells. I also have a treadmill and elliptical machine machines at home, but there’s no option to use those during your workout. I have once again contacted support to see if they can fix the problem.

The list on the left that I can see and move them around lessens the transition back and forth from task app to calendar app (the layout in all in one task+calendar apps were not visual friendly)\nI am excited to fully explore the possibilities using this app. Purchased one month premium and… I got billed, but the app is not updating granting access to premium features. Yes, I logged out, even reboot the phone. Nada… ended up spending 1hr+ trying to get the premium feature work. And decided to request refund and write this review.

Also, if a developer is going to charge for use of their app, they should NOT collect user data or at least offer users the option to opt out of data collection.

I was really hoping that with time, the developer would address some of the issues, but unfortunately, that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nI genuinely appreciate the concept of this app. Like many people, I struggle to get enough vitamin D, and this app has helped me become more mindful of that. Since I started using it, I’ve been intentional about stepping outside each day—even if only for a few minutes. It’s a small change that makes a big difference, especially when you work indoors all day.\n\nThat said, while the app runs smoothly on my iPhone, the Apple Watch version continues to disappoint. It constantly tells me to access the app from my phone, which defeats the purpose of having it on the watch. I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app, but doing so caused me to lose all the sunflowers I had collected—which was really frustrating.\n\nPlease consider updating the watch functionality. This app has so much potential and could be even more useful with proper Apple Watch support.",

It was personally embarrassing for any of my peers to see that not only did I have screen time as a high schooler but I had an app called Ohana. The app made it so my mom could see everything on my phone, and would look at everything on it which made me feel like I had no privacy in anything. Because not only could she track me but she could control and see everything on it. She would constantly question me on websites I was on which led to many misunderstandings and fights that could have been avoided. This also made me feel like I had no control over anything which crushed my self esteem, and would make me feel constantly angry with her and her need to control my life. It’s stupid to center your life around a phone, but to my generation we need a little freedom and a phone is a big step of freedom and having that taken away feels terrible.\nSo not only did this app lead to many fights that could have been avoided it made me have a sense of no freedom and caused me to get made fun of by my friends. If you get this app please don’t use it as my parents have.",

And if there are teams, there isn’t an option to score for separate teams and moreover, it doesn’t really get to the point of the game as to who knows who the best, because it’s a conglomerate of guesses.

Unfortunately if you tap on App support, it still takes you to a WhatsApp page. I asked the question of the AI, wanting to see if there was truly a copy/pasted function in the app. And I was NOT surprised at all to find out that the copy function was nonexistent. Please update the app again and this time really and truly have a copy function that actually works. Also, please put in an email of the app developer, or have the link take a person to a page where they can submit an issue. The last thing I want to do is to install an app or get on some weird conversation just to talk to the developer. I had high hopes for this app, but they are definitely waning. I wanted App support. Went to AppStore, pressed App Support, all I got was a screen telling me to join Extreme Chatbot AI Channel. I would like to be able to COPY the text from the AI into something else. For example, I had asked how to best organize my day, and it gave a good response - but there was no way to copy the text. I don’t know if the app saves all conversations or not, but even if it does, sometimes there’s and update, and “OOPSIE! Your previous conversations went away”.",

Your current “…select the lifetime $129.99 option to redeem. You should not see a price upon checkout” is not sufficient to guarantee a Free Lifetime without any charges upon checkout. Why? you may ask…I have been recently burned twice by two different developers with the same verbiage to get the Free Lifetime. In both cases I was charged and in both cases, after contacting the developers, I was told, “You selected the $x.xx option, so you were charged the agreed upon price. The “app advertiser” said it was Free Lifetime and said to select the $x.xx option and you should not see a price upon checkout, not us.” So, another way to scam the customers is making the rounds. If you really are intending to give a Free Lifetime opportunity to your customers, then adding those two words to the checkout confirmation should not be a big deal and will provide the developer-customer trust that is fast becoming a thing of the past, which is a shame. Most developers are hard-working and honest and I really hope you are one of those, but I cannot take a third chance with the same verbiage and this time with a potential price tag of $129.99. I am not saying you are scamming anyone, I am just asking for a confirmation of whether or not you are, without potentially paying $129.99 for the answer. Once I have the answer, I will be very happy to update my review with the answer, whichever way the chips fall. Thank you.",

I was glad to discover an “offline” barometric pressure access and altitude app and for free at that, through the promotion (that’s always a nice and yet often under appreciated gesture and imo a smart way to get the word out about your work). \n\nHowever, after onboarding the app blurred out data readings with a “motion data access needed” screen but with no explanation or direction to resolve it (iOS 18.5, iPhone 11). \nAfter time spent exploring settings options (trying this and that to enable it) in vain, I gave up and deleted it in disappointment. \n\nFurther still, I noted that the app description in store wants access to your financial data, something that I haven’t seen too often in apps that I explore or use, prioritizing security and privacy over brand and developer where possible. Transparency on what data you are in fact surrendering and to whom it is given is a legitimate consideration. \nThis reviewer tends to be suspicious when apps go free, have rushed or incomplete menus or onboarding, but want financials. In this case, it was asserted that only Apple has access to that data- probably so… so don’t let me spoil the barrel. \n\nHaving said that, offline functionality is an enticing attraction but the breakdown for me came in the lack of clarity as to enabling the access the app needs to function. I still don’t have that info and as such I cannot rate the app’s merit or efforts sufficiently or objectively. As they are a two man developer team, I can respect the effort but if I can’t use it yet..",

The Sherman-like vehicle they used for all the adds is a $20 purchase. You have an ad after you reach the finish in every mission, even if you haven’t delivered all of the cargo. When it comes down to the actual missions, a decent number of them have more cargo than you can fit in the 2 9 slot trailers you can use, but some of the cargo is larger than will fit in the base trailer, and you cannot advance past a campaign without delivering cargo in every mission. The only way to complete those missions or to haul all cargo at once is to rent one of the two other trailers, one of them you watch an ad to rent, but it’s only for 1 time, if you have to repeat the mission, you have to watch an ad again. The other trailer requires 30 gold coins to rent. Permanently unlocking both trailers is locked behind a $20 pay wall.",

But it is purely built for a spender experience. There are no rewards for early chapter completion besides resources which you passively gain regardless. The free pass has some tickets you can use at the commissary but with the extremely low amount they give you and the amount of time it takes to grind the pass it’s basically irrelevant compared to a spender.\nMy worst experience so far is on the commissary chests, you have a (Open x amount of chests for a GUARANTEED EPIC ITEM) so I open that many chests and don’t get one on the one that was supposed to be guaranteed. Then I open two more just for 3 greens each. Then the probability tracker completely disappeared from the chest. \n\nI’m sure this is just early bugs and poor user experience but I do really hope the developers consider having a more rewarding experience for F2P.

Other time the wording is a little off or confusing, such as a character who is looking for a woman that he refers to sometimes as his mom, and other times as his wife. Surely she isn’t both! \n\nBut oh, at other times, the English is incomprehensible to the point of making it very difficult to figure out what the game wants you to do next. \n\nAnd worst of all, on multiple occasions the English is outright offensive, making this game NOT AT ALL SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN as it claims. \n\nI agree with other reviewers that the UI controls could be better, and the game does at times glitch or freeze, and not all character dialogue can be skipped which is annoying. \n\nBut before tackling any of that, please, please, dear game developers: have a native English speaker clean up the mess of translations in this otherwise sweet and cozy game! \n\nI wanted to love Sunset Hills so much. And I’m pretty intuitive - I even played Neko Atsume when it was only available in Japanese. I’ve also played other games with problems, but never bothered to review a game till now,  because the English is just THAT BAD and incredibly detrimental to playing the game.",

The base game is fun but the amount of money investment it requires is ridiculous. I paid some money for the game. But the weekly challenges are not only bugged, but require you to invest probably hundreds of dollars just to meet the weekly quests.

For example, I’ve already completed the tutorial and I thought that afterwards, the game would be more open and allow me to complete puzzles in any way I want, but it’s almost as if the tutorial is extended throughout the first 5-7 packs, before you can even unlock the daily challenge, which really started to sour the deal, as with stitch., you didn’t have to complete 5-7 puzzles to unlock the daily challenge, should I be remembering correctly. Plus, I had issues with stickers not “locking” into place, and if I was so much as a little bit off, the game would reject my move even if it’s the last one.? For sure some work to be done on be game!",

All of the other developers give me unlock codes, because I and my review team garner a ton of revenues, I give fabulous advice and I help the gamers. Just once it would be nice to feel appreciated by you, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. The following critique is more to aid my wonderful gamers than to help you.\nFirst of all, you need to improve the quality and clarity of your graphics. Secondly, for what we pay, there should be a zoom feature in the HO scenes. I don’t know why you took it away in the first place.  In certain HO scenes it was extremely dark and the zoom would have been a big help! Next, the players hated the mini-games! They were mainly boring rotational puzzles, and several had so many parts that the gamers did not want to complete them. Your target demographic is women over the age of 50, who do not particularly like rotational mini-games. They would rather have mazes and labyrinths and painting and logic problems. Your general gameplay was enjoyable and innovative, and it would have been better if there had been more actual gameplay than mini-games which were not only rotational but had so many parts. The last one even I could not complete, because touchscreen sensitivity precluded me from moving the strings into the given shapes. Plus there were six of them! The second half with moving the rainbow pieces worked okay though. The HO scenes had a nice variety. So basically you need to supply us with puzzles that we will actually enjoy doing, not dreading them!\nIf I were you I would take my advice very seriously, and do as I ask. You did so with the map marks and by labeling inventory. I am steering you in the correct direction. \nUnfortunately I cannot give a game that was actually quite good the rating it should have because the puzzles were exhausting and miserable. Therefore my rating will be 3.5 stars. Just remember, if you choose not to take my advice, I can easily block revenues, and I won’t hesitate to do so. I’ve made you very successful and you’ve done nothing to thank me! I should feel appreciated, as the other developers make me feel. I do not like rating a game that was decent on the low side.",

The game is your typical strategy/simulator game like Whiteout Survival. Build your city, join an alliance, control the map, etc. Very straightforward. Resource management is lacking, UI isn’t the best, the game simply doesn’t do anything that another game does infinitely better. Honestly, I thought Avatar deserved better. \nNotably, this game is filled to the brim with bots. My inbox was flooded day in and day out with spam messages about random discord servers. Which is odd for the gate keeping mechanics that disallow global chat until a higher level. Lastly, maybe it was just the server I was dropped in, but it was lousy with p3do apologists, so that’s not cool.",

The story seems like it’s going to be interesting, but the conclusion has several holes. Several very uninteresting side plots and stories - why should I care about them? I just wanted to get to the end of the game, but I felt like I was being dragged on and on.\nAnd as for the horror element, it’s pretty easy to avoid the horror. Which I don’t mind necessarily… but I think the predictability makes it boring.\n\n2 stars because I don’t appreciate the amount of time I spent on meaningless side quests in the game.",

Of course an idle battle doesn’t necessarily need a great story, but I found it to be a missed opportunity.\n\nAlso, I think adding some manual play would kick it up a notch. I feel that an idle battler should have that option of control as well if preferred.\n\nAs far as paid transactions, I feel like this game is highly generous in giveaways gem and character materials, so I didn’t feel a strong need to make purchases.

It actually annoys you so bad you start to get angry with the game. It no longer becomes fun anymore. Why can’t this game do the same as GOLF CLASH , and be consistent and actually have an explanation of their wind guide?\nAnd fyi, it helps if you don’t IGNORE players. My husband and I may wind up leaving the game if they don’t fix the wind bug . So don’t waste your time, it’s noting close to golf clash and most other golf games precision. In amateurs level you’ll be fine, you’ll find no wind issues , but as soon as you level up to rookie, the winds are all over the place and you never have any consistency at all. Players beware . I’ll change my review if they fix the Problem, otherwise they honestly don’t care about fixing the issue, that’s quite obvious by ignoring my repeated inquires for some guidance with this issue. It May be better to try golf clash, ultimate golf, or golf rival if you want consistency and fun without being extremely annoyed .",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "The art of the game is cute and the entire aesthetic is pleasant. However, the game’s potential to be very calming is undercut by the frustrating fact that it is difficult to play a game where just tapping on an object can do way too many things, and accidentally tapping on the wrong thing annoyingly diverts the game. It would be much better if there were, say, separate modes for different actions. For instance, if I wanted to move the plants on my farm around, I could press a button and enter a separate mode to do so, and then afterwards press that button again to exit the mode. That way, when I’m collecting the harvest from my plants, I don’t have to worry about accidentally moving them around. I also wouldn’t have to worry about the little pet standing too near an object or plant so that when I feed it, the game thinks I’m trying to move that object and the pet disappears.\n\nIt’s also very frustrating that the game is set up mostly two-dimensionally and yet objects and plants can block one another! I want to be able to put rings of flowers around my trees, but I can’t because I won’t be able to harvest the flowers that I put behind the trees—not without the game thinking that I’m trying to move the trees around. \n\nOtherwise, the game is simple and fun. It just needs more work to make its interface more playable and less aggravating.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I’ve been using Tome since the beta days and was genuinely excited at first. It felt like the perfect space for book lovers. The concept was fresh, and the customization options were a fun way to make the app your own. It really seemed like it could be a thriving, supportive community.\n\nBut honestly, if I were a new user coming in now, I’d feel completely lost. The layout is congested, confusing, and lacks any real guidance. Nothing is intuitive, and with how the algorithm and community function, it feels nearly impossible for new users to be seen. Unless you’re already part of the in-crowd, you disappear into the noise.\n\nI was deeply invested. I subscribed, became a Tome Keeper, and actively participated because I had faith in the product and believed in its potential. But over time, that faith turned into disappointment.\n\nThe app often feels like posting into the void unless you’re part of a tight-knit group. The badge system is tied to tokens, which you either have to buy with real money or receive as a gift from someone who spent their own. Tokens are then used to buy profile badges that are mostly tied to obscure inside jokes or designed for specific cliques. As a subscriber, you receive a monthly allowance of 1400 tokens, but beyond buying badges, I honestly don’t know what the point of them is. The system feels more cosmetic than meaningful.\n\nPeople can also gift tokens by reacting to posts with a bread emoji—yet another inside joke that isn’t explained anywhere in the app. It’s a system that largely benefits users already plugged into the culture, especially those active in the Discord.\n\nA lot of the app’s culture and inside jokes come from the Tome Discord. While it includes various channels, I felt its original purpose was to report bugs, receive updates, and give feedback. But now it primarily reinforces the exclusivity already present on the platform. Some users are so involved in maintaining their presence that they update their profiles multiple times a day to match ongoing jokes. That level of effort is a lot, and it only seems to pay off if you’re already known.\n\nTome also runs monthly profile contests that require a huge amount of time and design effort. In theory, they’re creative and fun. In practice, the winners almost always come from the same social circles. Votes are cast by other users, but the algorithm boosts the same few popular accounts - making it hard for new or outside voices to be seen. It feels more like a popularity contest than a celebration of creativity.\n\nUsers are encouraged to promote Tome on their social platforms, but there’s no real reward. Even ambassadors, who are given access to a private Discord channel, get nothing more than a sparkle emoji visible only to other ambassadors. It often feels like a lot of unpaid labor for superficial recognition.\n\nYou also can’t actually track your reads in a structured way. There’s no reading log, goal setting, or progress tracking. Instead, you can make a subpage to post your current reads, but it’s more like blogging than actual reading organization. Thoughtful reviews are often ignored, while most engagement goes to posts about shadow daddies or thirsting over app creators. It feels more like a fandom-heavy Tumblr than a space for genuine book connection.\n\nTome had a great idea, and I respect the original vision. But the current version feels performative, cliquish, and overwhelmingly busy. It doesn’t prioritize the reader experience—and definitely not the new reader experience. I’m giving it 2 stars for the concept and potential, but it’s not the inclusive or functional book space I hoped it would be.",

The glitches are never ending, it won't give me my 100 gems for logging into facebook, I have coins stuck in places that I can't click on, there's at least 3 different \"events\" going on at once so it's impossible to get all of the rewards which is basically the only way to get more energy without having to buy it. And it's impossible to make friends on this game which is the only way to get rewards for feeding their pets and watering their plants. When you have to \"travel\" to a different location for an \"event\" the game glitches and the screen moves by itself and they make you think the travel location has a different set of energy but it does not, plus if you buy energy with your in game money at the travel location it's 2x the price it would be if you just went home and bought the energy there. So many things that could easily be fixed but they don't give you any easy way to contact support in the app. Hoping they fix things, I love this game!",

I gave it multiple chances across different types of tasks: storytelling, roleplay, emotional conversation, even basic logic. It failed each time.
