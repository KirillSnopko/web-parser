I usually go several words before needing a hint and it would be nice to see a countdown so I could make an educated decision about using it or just skipping the word. \n\n2: If I skip a word, it doesn’t tell me what the correct answer is. Seems like a simple improvement that could help users learn something new and get better at the game.\n\n3: The tile font needs to change.

I would never recommend this game to anybody.. the app is purposely designed to immediately CRASH upon a fast time and most likely win especially whenever you wage more than 2 credits. It eats up your wager plus your winnings so it’s impossible to maintain credit balance by design because it crashes a good 40% of games. That or a “Uh oh! Doesn't look like that worked.\nYou have less than an hour to submit your score. Retry when you are connected to the internet”. message, which doesn’t do anything when you tap on NEXT even though you know your Wi-Fi connection is solid and fast so you are forced to quit the app and restart it. (If it doesn’t crash, then it’s this issue - about 70% of the time!)\nThen when you restart the app, the last game isn’t recorded. A quality app does not waste the user's time. It is not a continuous money grab that preys on people who don't understand that by nature it is designed to take and take and never give.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "App Review: A Deceptive Experience\n\nI recently downloaded an app that was featured on the “Apps Gone Free” platform, promising a 24-hour promotional offer for lifetime access at no cost. Enticed by the offer, I installed the app and proceeded through the setup process. However, upon reaching the final step to redeem the free lifetime access, I encountered a significant issue: a banner obscured the submit button, rendering it unclickable. This obstruction prevented me from completing the redemption process. ￼ ￼\n\nSubsequently, I discovered that instead of receiving the promised free lifetime access, I was enrolled in a yearly subscription costing $14.99. This unexpected charge felt deceptive and manipulative. The developers’ decision to obscure the redemption button suggests a deliberate attempt to funnel users into a paid subscription under the guise of a free offer. ￼\n\nIn response to this experience, I have removed my payment information from my iTunes Apple ID to prevent any further unauthorized charges. This incident has left me feeling frustrated and disillusioned, as I have never encountered such tactics with any other app.\n\nI strongly advise potential users to exercise caution before downloading this app. The developers appear to prioritize their financial gain over user trust and transparency. Such practices undermine the integrity of promotional offers and erode user confidence.\n\nRating: ★☆☆☆☆",

However, the description offers minimal insight. \n\nIt does not photograph when you unlock your phone, it photographs when you open this app. So you must leave it in the foreground when you lock your phone for it to work. \n\nAdditionally, there is a delay, and I tested it; if you swipe out of the app before it manages to capture, you bypass the photograph and nothing is recorded. \n\nAlso, the passcode sound alert is when THIS app’s custom entry passcode is typed wrong - not when your phone’s lock screen passcode is typed wrong.\n\nThere are no instructions for use to make sure I’m not missing anything, and very few customization features to toy with. I’m sure that actually capturing a photo upon unlock by a third party app does not fall within the security parameters by Apple. However, I believe there could still be some creative workarounds to eloquently trigger a log more quickly and efficiently without being too intrusive. \n\nI would love to see two things; an iCloud sync so I can check the log from another device in case it is stolen, as well as an improvement in the activity log UI. I have to click the trash can to delete one photo at a time, and type my passcode each time. Why is there no select box or ‘select all’ button?",
