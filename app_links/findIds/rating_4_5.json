The same concept applies to most levels. At minimum there should be a ghost effect until you make your next shot once the ball has been set. A power bar would be better than numbers 0-100 for visual and speed of shoot purposes. Physics seem a bit off when the ball bounces. Over the gameplay is awful.

This isn‚Äôt great for people who take longer to read in any language, this is especially difficult if the language isn‚Äôt using the latin alphabet. I‚Äôm learning Russian, so i‚Äôm having to remember a whole new alphabet, read and process it quickly, i‚Äôm a native english speaker and i can‚Äôt even do that with english! At least when i came into this i already knew the alphabet because i‚Äôm using this to supplement my duolingo lessons as well. I also find it very unfair that people at a much higher level, using the fluency pass can be matched with you in PvP. 90% of the questions i am left guessing on.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to give up on playing, but thats my two cents on it.

This also made me feel like I had no control over anything which crushed my self esteem, and would make me feel constantly angry with her and her need to control my life.

Unfortunately if you tap on App support, it still takes you to a WhatsApp page. I asked the question of the AI, wanting to see if there was truly a copy/pasted function in the app. And I was NOT surprised at all to find out that the copy function was nonexistent. Please update the app again and this time really and truly have a copy function that actually works. Also, please put in an email of the app developer, or have the link take a person to a page where they can submit an issue. The last thing I want to do is to install an app or get on some weird conversation just to talk to the developer. I had high hopes for this app, but they are definitely waning. I wanted App support. Went to AppStore, pressed App Support, all I got was a screen telling me to join Extreme Chatbot AI Channel. I would like to be able to COPY the text from the AI into something else. For example, I had asked how to best organize my day, and it gave a good response - but there was no way to copy the text. I don‚Äôt know if the app saves all conversations or not, but even if it does, sometimes there‚Äôs and update, and ‚ÄúOOPSIE! Your previous conversations went away‚Äù.",

I just use it for my saturation sessions since the auto affirming feature makes it easier for me to saturate since I don‚Äôt wanna click the button to count each time myself & I enjoy watching the numbers as I continue my sessions. \n\nHowever, I have the app 3 stars because 1. ai art 2. I wish you could add more affirmations to track without paying for premium. Not too many more as I understand they need to make their money but 4 seems like such a low amount. And 3. I really hope that one day there are more ways to do saturation sessions. \n\nI‚Äôve found that I end up really wanting to do rampages (so affirming using a bunch of different affirmations) but I stop myself because I don‚Äôt want to inaccurately track how many times I said a particular affirmation (the one the current session is tracking) and I also hope the kind of methods you can select for affirmation sessions are upgraded too to include things like having inner conversations, rampages, scrolling Pinterest, etc. \n\nI‚Äôm still new to using this app so it may be possible to do rampage saturation sessions and I don‚Äôt even realize it lol.

The game is your typical strategy/simulator game like Whiteout Survival. Build your city, join an alliance, control the map, etc. Very straightforward. Resource management is lacking, UI isn‚Äôt the best, the game simply doesn‚Äôt do anything that another game does infinitely better. Honestly, I thought Avatar deserved better. \nNotably, this game is filled to the brim with bots. My inbox was flooded day in and day out with spam messages about random discord servers. Which is odd for the gate keeping mechanics that disallow global chat until a higher level. Lastly, maybe it was just the server I was dropped in, but it was lousy with p3do apologists, so that‚Äôs not cool.",

It would be much better if there were, say, separate modes for different actions. For instance, if I wanted to move the plants on my farm around, I could press a button and enter a separate mode to do so, and then afterwards press that button again to exit the mode. That way, when I‚Äôm collecting the harvest from my plants, I don‚Äôt have to worry about accidentally moving them around. I also wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the little pet standing too near an object or plant so that when I feed it, the game thinks I‚Äôm trying to move that object and the pet disappears.\n\nIt‚Äôs also very frustrating that the game is set up mostly two-dimensionally and yet objects and plants can block one another! I want to be able to put rings of flowers around my trees, but I can‚Äôt because I won‚Äôt be able to harvest the flowers that I put behind the trees‚Äînot without the game thinking that I‚Äôm trying to move the trees around. \n\nOtherwise, the game is simple and fun.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I‚Äôve been using Tome since the beta days and was genuinely excited at first. It felt like the perfect space for book lovers. The concept was fresh, and the customization options were a fun way to make the app your own. It really seemed like it could be a thriving, supportive community.\n\nBut honestly, if I were a new user coming in now, I‚Äôd feel completely lost. The layout is congested, confusing, and lacks any real guidance. Nothing is intuitive, and with how the algorithm and community function, it feels nearly impossible for new users to be seen. Unless you‚Äôre already part of the in-crowd, you disappear into the noise.\n\nI was deeply invested. I subscribed, became a Tome Keeper, and actively participated because I had faith in the product and believed in its potential. But over time, that faith turned into disappointment.\n\nThe app often feels like posting into the void unless you‚Äôre part of a tight-knit group. The badge system is tied to tokens, which you either have to buy with real money or receive as a gift from someone who spent their own. Tokens are then used to buy profile badges that are mostly tied to obscure inside jokes or designed for specific cliques. As a subscriber, you receive a monthly allowance of 1400 tokens, but beyond buying badges, I honestly don‚Äôt know what the point of them is. The system feels more cosmetic than meaningful.\n\nPeople can also gift tokens by reacting to posts with a bread emoji‚Äîyet another inside joke that isn‚Äôt explained anywhere in the app. It‚Äôs a system that largely benefits users already plugged into the culture, especially those active in the Discord.\n\nA lot of the app‚Äôs culture and inside jokes come from the Tome Discord. While it includes various channels, I felt its original purpose was to report bugs, receive updates, and give feedback. But now it primarily reinforces the exclusivity already present on the platform. Some users are so involved in maintaining their presence that they update their profiles multiple times a day to match ongoing jokes. That level of effort is a lot, and it only seems to pay off if you‚Äôre already known.\n\nTome also runs monthly profile contests that require a huge amount of time and design effort. In theory, they‚Äôre creative and fun. In practice, the winners almost always come from the same social circles. Votes are cast by other users, but the algorithm boosts the same few popular accounts - making it hard for new or outside voices to be seen. It feels more like a popularity contest than a celebration of creativity.\n\nUsers are encouraged to promote Tome on their social platforms, but there‚Äôs no real reward. Even ambassadors, who are given access to a private Discord channel, get nothing more than a sparkle emoji visible only to other ambassadors. It often feels like a lot of unpaid labor for superficial recognition.\n\nYou also can‚Äôt actually track your reads in a structured way. There‚Äôs no reading log, goal setting, or progress tracking. Instead, you can make a subpage to post your current reads, but it‚Äôs more like blogging than actual reading organization. Thoughtful reviews are often ignored, while most engagement goes to posts about shadow daddies or thirsting over app creators. It feels more like a fandom-heavy Tumblr than a space for genuine book connection.\n\nTome had a great idea, and I respect the original vision. But the current version feels performative, cliquish, and overwhelmingly busy. It doesn‚Äôt prioritize the reader experience‚Äîand definitely not the new reader experience. I‚Äôm giving it 2 stars for the concept and potential, but it‚Äôs not the inclusive or functional book space I hoped it would be.",
