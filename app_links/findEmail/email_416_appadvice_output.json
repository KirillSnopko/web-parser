The problem is that Toddlers do not just touch once and wait for the narrator to speak before touching another fruit. It ends up sounding like a rap song and even when the child touches the correct item, there is such a lag from all the repeats that the child is confused and gets frustrated.

But if I’m going to decide to delete a video I want to be able to look at the video. Can’t preview the media files, no names of file, no sizes. So I couldn’t find the video again even if I wanted to look myself. Same goes for the picture compare. The gamification swipe to use as a good way to review pictures quickly to say keep dump, I like. Very useful. Fix other issues I’ll give a 5 star.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I’m writing after I saw that your sleep sound app “Moonlight : Sleep & Sounds” was shown as the top feature over on App Advice, with your lifetime subscription being offered for free just for today only. I read everything over and I was excited to accept your offer and then try things out (sleep issues seem to be somewhat of a constant for me since I reached adulthood). I followed the link, completed the download of your app and then I began the onboarding process (all pretty standard fair when accepting this sort of an offer through App Advice. Of which, I’ve been doing for close to ten years now). However, something wasn’t working the way I assumed it ought to when trying to accept your offer today. When I reached  the screen suggesting I upgrade to the premium version of Moonlight : Sleep & Sounds, that was where I encountered the issue. Your offer was for a free lifetime subscription to your apps premium features, yet I was seeing all options priced normally. Generally, the lifetime option will show a price of $0.00 for you to select and “purchase” in the App Store when accepting these type of lifetime subscription offers through App Advice. I don’t feel comfortable going any further with the process with the lifetime subscription showing the full $29.99 price as that isn’t how this normally works. And if I end up being charged the full price, I know that trying to get an app developer to issue you a refund, regardless of the issue you experienced, that shi…. just isn’t happening, you know? I went back onto App Advice and the offer had not yet expired, so that shouldn’t be the issue, I don’t think. \n\n    How ‘bout a little help here aye? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn’t mind extending yourself and maybe helpin’ a brotha on this one. Is there someone I could message about this to see about getting  some help with this matter? Of course, I will straight away go and fix this rating and review after receiving y’all’s help on this issue. But yeah, I really hope to hear back from you about this issue I had and I look forward to trying out your new sleep app. Thanks guys! 🤝🏼\n\nCraig",

I’m learning Russian, so i’m having to remember a whole new alphabet, read and process it quickly, i’m a native english speaker and i can’t even do that with english! At least when i came into this i already knew the alphabet because i’m using this to supplement my duolingo lessons as well. I also find it very unfair that people at a much higher level, using the fluency pass can be matched with you in PvP. 90% of the questions i am left guessing on.\n\nI’m not going to give up on playing, but thats my two cents on it.

I had the timer running and once in a while the sound continues even after the timer stops. \nAnd talking about stopping the sound, why is there no option to fade out the sound rather than abruptly stopping it. With that, it is not possible (at least for me), to use the app to fall asleep. \nThe sound quality is only mediocre, e.g. the Brown Noise has a clicking sound every few seconds, or the rain is very short and then repeats in a very obvious manner. \n\nIt is unfortunate, but this app is not for me.",

Too many glitches for it to be “coincidence”. I say it is rigged algorithm. In the real board game you only get 2 decks of cards which allows you to strategize and you don’t get a long game just for kicks (or the inordinate number of jokers and card numbers). Just saying.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "Just on the sounds I’d give this app a 5. But the interface is just to disjointed and hard to use.   \n\nThe individual volume sliders are way too small and not sensitive enough. I have smaller hands and can’t get a volume set where I’d like.  It would be impossible with bigger fingers. \n\nPerhaps a thorough tutorial would help with some things. Make the sliders much larger and easier to set at a given lever. Explain some of the non-intuitive icons as I sort of understand what they do, but no idea what they really mean. \n\nA few interface tweaks and this would be a top notch relaxation app.\n\nLoops could be longer or with better connections.  Specially cat purr.  My cat never starts and stops every 3 seconds.",
