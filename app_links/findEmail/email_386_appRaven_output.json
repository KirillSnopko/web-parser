While both songs share themes of heartbreak, their musical styles and tempos didn’t quite align. Robyn’s track has an upbeat, dance-pop energy, whereas Ariana’s vocals are more delicate and melancholic. Because of this contrast, the lyrics didn’t blend naturally with the instrumental, making the mashup feel a bit off. I was hoping for a smooth mix, but the vibe differences made it challenging to get the right balance.",

Except even in that time, I experienced a bug where I use gems to unlock a room in my house and the next time that I logged into the game, that room was locked, and my gems had not been returned. It appears that they made a recent update. The customization feature of the characters was completely lost, and my characters appearance was completely reset. I am now unable to even open the customization menu to change their appearance, and the one time that I was allowed to I couldn’t access the clothing or changing the name of my farm because that also got changed when the game reset. I was really enjoying having a character who resembled me and now I have someone with very pale skin who does not resemble me. And the name of my farm has now been changed three times and one of them was into a language that I don’t speak. None of this would be too bad if I could fix it, which I can’t. So I’m not sure that I would recommend this game as it currently exists. But it has potential.",

Still stuck in purgatory on chapter 4 with all of my requirements fulfilled to move on, the game is just stuck. Much smoother without the other bugs, though. \n\nWonderful search-and-find game with cute characters and cuter stories from them. I can spend hours on end playing this trying to upgrade my tenant's apartments. However, I've reached a point where the game has just kind of stopped— I've unlocked up to the terrace, the 5th room. I was able to clear the room of all clutter, but now Juniper just stands in the corner, and the game won't allow me to unlock the new character despite showing all criteria being met, which leaves me at a dead end. I've also had to restart the game multiple times during gameplay, as it often gets frozen on ads, will glitch and not allow the player to zoom in/out, and sometimes upon restart will show a room that has already been unlocked as a dark void. The game itself is great and worth checking out, but would be better if I could progress further.",

There are a lot of connectivity issues(transactions taking days to load, for example) and buggyness, the app is a bit slow and is lacking features you would expect of such an expensive monthly subscription. \n\nThere are several features you would expect to be there, but aren’t. Two of my cards can’t even connect (Apple and an Amex) though this would primarily affect my cash flow values since I don’t spend on them. Also you set rules on repeating transactions, things like that.\n\nThat said, I love the direction of this app and look forward to updating my review once they get the kinks worked out.   Devs seem very responsive and like they are actively trying to improve the app. The community space in particular is innovative as well as the simplicity of the interface. Looking forward to what yall have coming next!",

Yeah, there are bots here and there in matchmaking, but I get it, the game’s still new.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I really think could make it better. First off, for a game that’s all about collecting awesome loot, it’s kind of a bummer that none of the gear shows up on your character. Like, I’d love to actually see the helmets, gloves, boots, and chest pieces I’m equipping. Right now, your character just has the default look no matter what. In 2025, that’s just not cutting it — especially when other, lower-budget games are doing this already.\n\nAlso, since co-op is a big part of the game, it’d be awesome to have some weapons or items that actually work together. Imagine if there was an electricity item that could connect between two players’ drops, or fire grenades that could combine effects — stuff like that would make teamwork way more fun and rewarding.\n\nOverall, I like where this is going, but there’s definitely room for some cool upgrades.",

Takes a bajillion clicks to build things manually which works by some funny wobbling animation as parts approach each other in a way that doesn’t make sense and doesn’t feel interactive. I stopped doing it except for the missions which force you to do it because you do nothing except tap until you get carpal tunnel. There’s a reindeer who doesn’t seem to do much except get sad and demand food, which just costs increasing amounts of money and it’s unclear what benefit it gives. There’s an “interact” screen where he stares blankly which seems pointless. There’s some automation and toys to unlock but each new toy is slower to make and earns less money than the last so it doesn’t feel like progression. So the only thing to do is open the game for 30 seconds every hour or so and collect from your factories until you get to the toy your next mission is for then tap like a zombie to build it and immediately forget about it. Not a fan of this game.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "The game opens with a strong set of visuals and story premise. The tutorial feels well integrated, but I was left wondering what this astronaut’s deal was. We don’t know where she was going or why. We have an objective-escape the planet- but I find it unusual that the astronaut’s first goal isn’t to get in touch with someone else about her crash- does she have no oversight? That would be fine for a solo explorer, except for a small tidbit of info dropped at the very end of the game. It feels like things just don’t add up.\n\nThe environments are very well realized for this type of adventure game, and very thoughtful in their functionality for mobile. I do wish the various creatures were better realized; at first, I felt like they must “actually” look like that on this strange planet. However, another reveal later in the game defies this idea and highlights that these silhouetted creatures definitely aren’t well thought out in terms of design.\n\nThe puzzles were reasonable; for better or worse, the days of sitting stuck on a tough puzzler for weeks to months without a walkthrough or guide are gone. Mobile does tend to make puzzling a little less robust- the types of puzzles begin to feel a bit repetitive by the end of the game. That said, they did feel well integrated into the world that was crafted.\n\nHowever, the character lines around the puzzles really cheapens the experience. I don’t want to feel like I’m being led around by the nose or that I’m listening to a kid’s TV show. Several times I wondered if this game was directed at kindergarteners because of the tone the astronaut was using. Still, I appreciate that the character is voice acted at all- full V.O.’s can be somewhat rare in the genre.\n\nOur astronaut is also very curious about the planet, but is adamant that she’s getting out of there ASAP. Isn’t she an explorer? well, here’s a chance to explore! More than once we also end up relying on her gut feelings, adding to how contrived the short story line feels.\n\nThe reveal in Act 5 is pretty cool; I didn’t know what to expect about the fate of the planet, but it wasn’t that. Unfortunately, the end of the game really leaves a lot to be desired. Apparently this game connects to something else the developer has done, but it wasn’t clear that you needed that knowledge ahead of time to make the ending feel exciting. It’s also possible that this game will get a sequel, but if it doesn’t, there are so many unanswered questions created by the ending that it feels incredibly unsatisfying. I did not expect to end this game feeling very sad about the outcome for the astronaut and other environments/creatures/etc, but that’s where I’m at.\n\nFinal thing:  the musical sting used in cut scenes is really great! But it gets old fast. A little more variety would have been nice. \n\nOverall okay. I’d add a half star if I could just to support the work that went into all the art, but I just think the story isn’t tight enough to support the experience this game needed to really make a splash.",
