I am able to use my email and password to correctly login to the website and everything is fine. However, I input my same credentials on this app and I get an error that says either the username or password is incorrect, which doesn’t make sense.\n\nI would love to be able to use the app and continue studying for certifications while I’m not at my PC, but cannot do so at the moment because of this issue.\n\nAs for LetsDefend itself, I am in love with this style of learning and how it’s all set up. It’s very structured and the quizzes at the end make sure you understand everything before you move on to a new module. At least for the PC version, there are also labs that you can connect to that allow you to interact with the learning material even further, which makes everything so much smoother for overall comprehension. You receive badges at the end of each major module and for the VIP version, you get a certificate for each completed course that you can show to employers.\n\nI highly recommend the website (can’t really say the app for now) for anyone looking to get into Cybersecurity.\n\nThanks and Good Luck!",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "Usually when I’ve played other games from these devs I rarely see many bugs and issues, but with this one I do. Now don’t get me wrong this is a good game and i enjoyed it but the bugs ruin it a bit.\n\nThe Random Crashes Problem:\nFor example there are idk.. I’ll estimate around 3-6 buttons that crash ur game when pressed making some features completely unusable. \n\nThe Series Problem:\nAnd when you make a series well… at first it works fine but after a bit u realize it’s saying ur releasing WAY more episodes than u actually are. Now that’s fine I suppose just a issue with the way it calculates my episodes. But there is another problem, when u make a second series and make a episode in that series it for some reason bugs out and says it’s in both series?!?! Like for example both ur first series and ur second series will show the exact same stats.\n\nThe YouView Problem:\nWell it’s not rlly a problem, the devs were just a bit lazy when making this part. I assume they used part of the same code from their music sim game in here. Like for example when u click on smth u uploaded the top comment will say smth either abt the non existent music video or how well the artist did, and as you can clearly tell this is a game about making a podcast not music.\n\nThe GameCenter LeaderBoard Glitch:\nIt doesn’t actually show accurate stats. Like for example I have around 11.5k active paid subs on my play thru and yet when u check the leader board I’m somehow only at 230?!?! And this also goes for the money leaderboard I literally have 133m cash and yet it says I only have 6.1m.\n\nIf Ur Still Reading This:\nI want to say that this game has just recently came out, maybe 1-3 days before this review and there is clear room for improvement with further updates.\n\nMy Review On This Game:\nit’s a decently fun game and I enjoyed myself however it does seem like very rushed/lazy work from the devs and I’m honestly wondering if they even tested out there game once before releasing it. Because I honestly don’t understand how they could’ve tested out the game and not known of these issues.",

While both songs share themes of heartbreak, their musical styles and tempos didn’t quite align. Robyn’s track has an upbeat, dance-pop energy, whereas Ariana’s vocals are more delicate and melancholic. Because of this contrast, the lyrics didn’t blend naturally with the instrumental, making the mashup feel a bit off. I was hoping for a smooth mix, but the vibe differences made it challenging to get the right balance.",

The game is straight trash! It’s decent to play, and would be a good idle, only if they fixed the bugs and glitches! It super glitchy! Major glitchy! So drop money on the game! The daily doesn’t always work, when you click all the daily, a lot of the time is doesn’t register, and since you’ve already completed it, you can’t redo some of it! Then of course the gotcha part! It definitely fella rigged! Anyways, you’ve been warned!",

The camera being attached to an avatar was a terrible, yet easily correctable mistake. I, the viewer, should have full control of where I’m looking. If the virtual camera needs to move, it should be on rails and not jerking all over the place. Basically, don’t move the camera unless it’s absolutely necessary. I can understand that this can be a conundrum for certain scenes, like when she is falling, but this medium requires consideration and sacrifice to attract and keep the widest audience. Better to take that out of your story than to alienate an audience that doesn’t fair well with a camera that goes all over the place. \n2. When using AirPods for audio, the audio is terribly delayed. I did not try without. \n3. The last scene where you’re in a bar and the main character is a bit seductive in a slinky black dress, all whispering that she never wanted me to let go or whatever… yeah we don’t need that in a “Pixar-style experience”. I know some people enjoy sexualizing cartoons, but again - think about the audience and not wanting to alienate people. \n4. I have no idea what this even is. Since you’re developing what is basically a movie that the audience is a participant in, then you should’ve done more of a story trailer that tells me about this character, the world… why we are hanging out with this character and what their motivation is. Instead, I got what feels like a college game design project that you got a good grade on and didn’t want to go to waste after you graduated. It’s a random, nonsensical experience that has no rhyme or reason. You mention Pixar, so maybe go watch some trailers, then redo this whole thing like an immersive movie trailer rather than what it currently is. \n5. I also wanted to mention that when I first launched the app, my surroundings dimmed and I got an Apple logo, but not the VP Apple logo. It looked more like you added it as a loading icon or something, but IDK. Anyways, I was unable to force quit or do anything, so I had to restart. Thereafter when I launched the app the audio wouldn’t work and after showing the studio logo it would just go back to the “tap to start” screen over and over until I force quit the app and relaunched. \n6. Good on you for taking the time to learn and grow as a creative individual. Keep at it!",

And now you're releasing the same app, PlayBeat 4, which is superior to the previous version and is compatible with my device. You're definitely being very mean and shameless. As a consumer, I'm speaking out against these outrageous marketing strategies. I don't see the difference between charging a direct price for purchase and offering it for free, installing it, and then having to pay to unlock its most important and functional parts. And thank goodness you don't have that other absurd subscription strategy, which is a real rip-off. I don't understand why there are people who pay monthly or yearly for something they already bought. In conclusion, I've realized that you, as developers, program apps to work on your chosen versions of iOS. You've already demonstrated this with this bad trick: PlayBeat 3 iOS v. 13 or higher, and now PlayBeat 4, compatible with iOS lower than v. 13, free, with a fee for general unlocking. Your apps are great, but your marketing strategies leave much to be desired. I want you to understand my dissatisfaction as a consumer.",

Learn skills, buffs and skill slots. Skills belong to a category and can be equipped by any job that has a skill slot of the same category once unlocked.  \n- 15 stat categories which is a lot for most. \n- 6 equipment slots, gear can have up to 3 RNG enchantments on it plus main stat (maybe more with progression). Gear is not job restricted. \n\nCons\n- Needs PSAs. \n- Poor inventory management. I could use maybe 5+ pre-sets to quickly change gear as right now it’s very tedious switching between offensive gear, xp gear, item drop gear and some jobs that need specific stats. Delete all items with zero enchantment would be greatly appreciated as well. \n- skills aren’t explained well. \n- Jobs tend to start with their drawbacks and you have to invest a lot of time or boost to find out if they are even good at all. E.I. Blind samurai job starting with -100% hit chance is way to rough for only a tier 2 job as it’s not possible balance that high of a debuff that soon in the game. \n- jobs should have buff slots as well similar to skill slots. \n- enchantments should include attack as well as more offensive stats to balance out all the defensive stats. \n- it doesn’t seem to have a huge focus on speed consider it’s the name of the game.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "Dear Developer, I wish you all the success, and regret that no one may have told you these truths I am about to mention, in hopes of your overall improvements. Nothing I am about to mention is intended in any way to be discouraging personal attacks, but sincere feedback:\n\nHave you played “Armored Core6?” That is what a realistic ‘graphene’ future mech game should be. But this Exoloper game is making me pull my hair out. Crash at tutorial startup. Will not load tutorials second boot up, then tutorial is permanently gone. 1 stars is too much for this game. Worst mech game I ever seen, but why?…I list ten reasons, with the last being most scientific, and if you can skip to 10, that one would still be the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\n1-Slow servo mech, not even “metal-gear-solid-rex” like. Mechs are wrongfully envisioned by grandpa to be trope slow bulldozers.(proof in reason 10 But I digress…)\n\n2-Worst than mech warrior1. -Objectives blown up-blows up entire map, killing all players, what is the point then?\n\n3 -Small reason, Nukes are placed on the ground instead of fired so its suicide. (The blast radius red indicator does not match actual damage radius by hundredfold?)\n\n4-Worst clunkiest controls I ever seen. You are forced to move at a paddle instead of instant control response like “w,a,s,d,” or right left foward back, or two way directional joystick, and x,y,z aim. 50% of screen cuts off.\n\n5-Small reason, Did I also mention, forgive me for saying, the mechs shape are so ugly and poorly designed a child could draw a better humpdy dumpty potato with tiny sticks for legs?! Dwarf walker, short legs alone are obsolete. Use your imagination. But this can be worked on…\n\n6- Big reason, The audio is choppy and grinding things on the ground is like scratching chalk board cringe. (I think I have a headache).\n\n7 - Big reason, The screen is half covered by a blop of dark plates? So your play screen is reduced to 50%. (Tunnel vision will increase motion sickness).\n\n8-There are no dodging mechanics chaf flares or defensive mechanics of stealth or jets or anything. (Impairs users hand eye co ordination).\n\n9-🏆 I add one positive thing here: great focus on gameplay and less on textures and vain things. (Many new games nowadays, focus too much on graphics, they forget games are to be interactive, and not handholding movies).\n\n10-⚠️Most importantly- not generous with loadouts, the weight limit is unreal: have you heard of “flash graphene?” It is a dirt cheap polymer carbon8 material in real life that is 900x stronger than steel and 200x lighter, allowing future tanks to be the weight of a small van. Artificial muscles made of graphene, featured on DARPA and pop-science, can support entire bridges and sonic speed superman exosuits. Now please update your scifi with some real current modern tech, and learn to stay away from what people think“realistic”-western servo-slow mech expectations should be- and do some research please, “mech-warrior” is NOT the future. \n⚠️ Ergo ”Flash Graphene Artificial Muscles” is the REAL SCIENTIFIC PROOF that japanese “unrealistic” mechs are actually more feasible and in line with military industrial complex standards. Slow Western mechs are never going to make it into real combat, apart from fast UAV, UGV.\n\nThis exoloper game is not what a 2025 future mech game should be like.",

However, it struggles with performance lag, app compatibility, and missing features that users expect in 2024. Prioritizing speed optimizations, adding swipe typing/auto-caps, and refining the shift key logic would elevate it significantly. For privacy-focused users willing to sacrifice convenience today, it’s a decent option—but with updates, it could become a top-tier choice.",

Except even in that time, I experienced a bug where I use gems to unlock a room in my house and the next time that I logged into the game, that room was locked, and my gems had not been returned. It appears that they made a recent update. The customization feature of the characters was completely lost, and my characters appearance was completely reset. I am now unable to even open the customization menu to change their appearance, and the one time that I was allowed to I couldn’t access the clothing or changing the name of my farm because that also got changed when the game reset. I was really enjoying having a character who resembled me and now I have someone with very pale skin who does not resemble me. And the name of my farm has now been changed three times and one of them was into a language that I don’t speak. None of this would be too bad if I could fix it, which I can’t. So I’m not sure that I would recommend this game as it currently exists. But it has potential.",

Also chat does not work at all you can not communicate in the game and they make it difficult to team up as well as it has full gated timers on when you can enter in stuff they need to remove the gated timers so you can go in anytime to fight bosses and other missions this really needs to be addressed. The game needs to be fixed part if the game is in Russian, some Asian language, and English you can not read quite a bit of menus. Also this game has 666 all in it literally and it has a Lucifer transformation I wish they would remove that demonic stuff from the game and change it to something else.

Quick renders, more options, accuracy, something! \n\nThis app does the minimum and if that’s all you need, if you aren’t picky like me, or you just want an app to do a few images & move on - this will do the trick, so it’s certainly not terrible, it’s not a ripoff, and not a cash grab. Get it if all you need is basic imagery, just a few fun pic’s and accuracy isn’t required.\n\nUPDATE\nI have to add that the dev is VERY cool and listens. The fact that they took an unflattering review to heart and listened to the honest review speaks volumes. I believe - going forward - that this app will grow and evolve into something special.

Much smoother without the other bugs, though. \n\nWonderful search-and-find game with cute characters and cuter stories from them. I can spend hours on end playing this trying to upgrade my tenant's apartments. However, I've reached a point where the game has just kind of stopped— I've unlocked up to the terrace, the 5th room. I was able to clear the room of all clutter, but now Juniper just stands in the corner, and the game won't allow me to unlock the new character despite showing all criteria being met, which leaves me at a dead end. I've also had to restart the game multiple times during gameplay, as it often gets frozen on ads, will glitch and not allow the player to zoom in/out, and sometimes upon restart will show a room that has already been unlocked as a dark void. The game itself is great and worth checking out, but would be better if I could progress further.",

The piano roll is very good but it’s so disconnected from the timeline and instruments that aren’t even visible in the left column ! Pure garbage that basically do nothing in the TIMELINE were most editing should be done . But no this is another fidgety cripple box like Logic . If the creators are serious they with make very detailed step by step tutorials on how to use the daw like a daw himself ! I’ve been told one guy does everything in this company which explains why there are no tutorials made by the company itself which is sorely needed here . The idea this is also a host for third parties apps which all the others drop the ball on and makes this one the one I want to really learn drives me insane. You tube dudes do the worst tutorials ever! They always start with minimum info on how to get a SONG going first but instead waste chapter after chapter with the stuff that should always come AFTER awe learn how to make a tune FIRST!

It would be better to call it \n\nTome: Romance Reading and Memes \n\nbecause that’s all your going to find on here. Plus the community is way too comfortable using and posting AI Images and I’m sick of seeing them.I already deleted my account.  \n\nEdit: dropping my rating because the latest update is absolute garbage! The main feed is now all “hot” posts my blocked tags no longer work, it’s just another social media app that pushes popularity\n\nCurrently it’s fine, the layout does feel messy with the different style of posts that are allowed. The profile customizing is cool in theory but does make looking at profiles difficult depending on the image the user is using. The posting styles feel restrictive, I wanted to use the book post style but I was being forced to rate it but I wasn’t done with it. Feels like it’s trying to be everything while not executing it very well.\n\nThe user base is more Romantasy and Romance readers than it is fantasy which kind of blows as it’s advertised as a fantasy platform. Either more people will join balancing out the pool or it’s really meant for those readers and this isn’t the app for me.\n\nMy biggest grip is that the block list doesn’t appear to work, if I have a hashtag or word blocked I literally should not be able to see it, regardless if it is being used alongside multiple other hashtags I don’t have blocked. If this worked properly I would probably have a better experience.",

Characters and abilities are diverse, and true to the marketing: no two games are the same. \n\nUnfortunately, Ubisoft does not trust the gameplay to retain players and generate revenue. Unlike League of Legends or, more recently, Marvel Rivals; Ubisoft has chosen to lock stats and abilities behind in-game currencies. The currencies can be earned slowly by playing, or paid for. Cosmetics can be paid for as well.\n\nIt's a common mobile game tactic, and it's typically required for retention in games that are compensating for a lackluster gameplay loop. \n\nIn BUMP's case, I think it's actually going to slash retention. This game is designed to attract MOBA enthusiasts more than RPG players, and MOBA players hate competitive inconsistencies more than anything.\n\nRevenue is required. But my hope for Bump! is that they trust the gameplay and follow in LoL's footsteps. \n\nTo make it 5 Stars:\n\nMake the roster expensive; but when you unlock a character, there's no level-up. Players all start with the same 6 characters, and then there's a weekly rotation of \"free\" characters. Expand on the lore and design cool cosmetics, people will pay for them. Let the gameplay retain players, and trust that an obsessed player base will be happily monetized.",

Running the stacked challenges without the required buffs are basically impossible. Sure once you get the golden run it feels great, but its still banking on luck.

There is some mechanic which makes the game go from building to fighting. Triggering that mechanic is based on ‘sound’, but the game doesn’t define what increases sound. Additionally, there are character types to add to help your village, like a chef, but adding in these units excessively increases the trigger. Adding even 1 reduces your time to breed new settlers. If you add more than 2 special units, the trigger goes off and the fight starts. Since these units are your fighters, you can never actually have enough plus they abandon their primary job to fight. Each battle just becomes a hope that your settlers can kill the enemy before it kills them. \n\nAdditionally, progression is non-existent. There are upgrades you can get, but these are randomly unlocked each run. Your goal is to get settlers to support upgrades and defeat the enemy on each island to then repair your boat. You go to a new island and start over. After a few islands, the credits role. If you lose all your settlers, you just  go to a new island with no consequences & hope you win the ‘base race’. \n\nThere seems to be a lot of variety in the game, but due to the lack of balance and unclear progression, there becomes 1 single build pathway you must take to have a chance. Lots of promise fumbled by unrefined execution.",

There are a lot of connectivity issues(transactions taking days to load, for example) and buggyness, the app is a bit slow and is lacking features you would expect of such an expensive monthly subscription. \n\nThere are several features you would expect to be there, but aren’t. Two of my cards can’t even connect (Apple and an Amex) though this would primarily affect my cash flow values since I don’t spend on them. Also you set rules on repeating transactions, things like that.\n\nThat said, I love the direction of this app and look forward to updating my review once they get the kinks worked out.   Devs seem very responsive and like they are actively trying to improve the app. The community space in particular is innovative as well as the simplicity of the interface. Looking forward to what yall have coming next!",

I love listening to the audio along with reading the book but it’s hard to do when it just keeps skipping and I like to do things while i’m listening so I don’t want to have to sit down and  open up the book to read to the part it skipped to.

Yeah, there are bots here and there in matchmaking, but I get it, the game’s still new.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I really think could make it better. First off, for a game that’s all about collecting awesome loot, it’s kind of a bummer that none of the gear shows up on your character. Like, I’d love to actually see the helmets, gloves, boots, and chest pieces I’m equipping. Right now, your character just has the default look no matter what. In 2025, that’s just not cutting it — especially when other, lower-budget games are doing this already.\n\nAlso, since co-op is a big part of the game, it’d be awesome to have some weapons or items that actually work together. Imagine if there was an electricity item that could connect between two players’ drops, or fire grenades that could combine effects — stuff like that would make teamwork way more fun and rewarding.\n\nOverall, I like where this is going, but there’s definitely room for some cool upgrades.",

It feels like there’s nothing to do, even if there is, and it just dumps you into the app with very little tutorials. I’m not asking for handholding, but I’ve been waiting years and I’m now dumped into an app with honestly annoying music and controls that don’t give feedback when pressed. I chose Dutch, which they said is incomplete, so maybe a bit of this is on me, but as far as I’m given, there are flashcards that do nothing for me, a matching bomb game, and a matching game where you type things out even if you haven’t seen these words before. There isn’t even the main mode open, which seems like something that should have been done first for every language. The animations are cute, but it’s stiff and doesn’t feel high quality for the time I spent waiting. And as I said before, the music is really annoying. It just plays in repeat the whole time. And pressing anything gives like no feed back in visuals or audio. It honestly makes me really sad since I looked up to the maker, personally wanting to be a polyglot and sharing their condition, but to receive the app in this state shattered my rise colored glasses a bit.\nThis app has potential, but it’s not ready for the public. The maker is a language learner, not an app programmer. I get he got help, but for the hype he made, he should have given this more time or hired better people. Just stick to Duolingo until this all has time to actually be made usable.",

It makes people not want to play your app. If you have more positive reviews due to the decrease of the amount of ads more people download you game and therefore see ads anyways but not constant ads, which means that people see the same amount of ads anyways and therefore might even be people seeing more ads which means more money.",

Takes a bajillion clicks to build things manually which works by some funny wobbling animation as parts approach each other in a way that doesn’t make sense and doesn’t feel interactive. I stopped doing it except for the missions which force you to do it because you do nothing except tap until you get carpal tunnel. There’s a reindeer who doesn’t seem to do much except get sad and demand food, which just costs increasing amounts of money and it’s unclear what benefit it gives. There’s an “interact” screen where he stares blankly which seems pointless. There’s some automation and toys to unlock but each new toy is slower to make and earns less money than the last so it doesn’t feel like progression. So the only thing to do is open the game for 30 seconds every hour or so and collect from your factories until you get to the toy your next mission is for then tap like a zombie to build it and immediately forget about it.

Maybe I can turn that Continue feature off - I don’t know.\n\nPeople forget that the first games, which had the best graphics of all these type games ever, were created by a different, small developer, I think Lone Wolf? \n\nAfter the purchase by or merge into Syntaxity the only completely original game has been Bigfoot - not as good. Since then they’ve really just expanded on the complex worlds already created. \n\nWill come back after I bother to finish this one with final review. Not sorry I bought it as the original games are still a joy to revisit. \n\nHad higher hopes though. Wish the original creators of the games were still making them. \n\nAs an FYI, I own Fire Maple & other developer games. The early games, now under Syntaxity, are hands down the best.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I get that significant cuts to the challenging content had to be made to do this 3d port, but both the final boss and the 4 optional superbosses are way too easy. I dropped Lunar Bahamut in 3 hits. Then I had nothing to use the reward on except an extremely weak final boss. \n\nI read about all these optional challenge dungeons in the 2d version that were cut from the 3d port, and that the original final dungeon was much bigger and contained way more bosses. So I was pretty disappointed to only find 4 optional bosses, no bonus dungeons, and a final boss that I was able to one shot. \n\nThese are just criticisms of the 3d port. The story is incredible. FF4 was the first RPG I ever played as a child and I’ve replayed it throughout my life. Finally playing the sequel at 38 was very satisfying and nostalgic. The story did an excellent job of developing beloved characters even further and bringing an extremely cool dark sci-fi twist to all the well worn but well executed fantasy tropes inherent to FF4. I may just have to play the 2d version on an emulator to get the full experience. This is a fun playthrough, but don’t expect too much of a challenge.\n\nIf you are having trouble with the endgame bosses for whatever reason, just get the limit ring and use the party needed to save Golbez for the difficult battles. That formation has a ton of powerful band attacks, the ultimate white and black magic, and excellent, tanky support. The vibra plus band can easily get to 99999 with the limit ring and only ties up two characters, leaving 3 for support. This is how I dropped lunar Bahamut in 3 hits and each phase of the final boss in one.",

Please consider reaching out to some artists to have some paintings made. I know you want to make money too, but take pride in your work and the creative people it takes to help it come into fruition. Plus it’s honestly really cringy to see a poorly made ai painting of a world that was literally built by real people.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "The game opens with a strong set of visuals and story premise. The tutorial feels well integrated, but I was left wondering what this astronaut’s deal was. We don’t know where she was going or why. We have an objective-escape the planet- but I find it unusual that the astronaut’s first goal isn’t to get in touch with someone else about her crash- does she have no oversight? That would be fine for a solo explorer, except for a small tidbit of info dropped at the very end of the game. It feels like things just don’t add up.\n\nThe environments are very well realized for this type of adventure game, and very thoughtful in their functionality for mobile. I do wish the various creatures were better realized; at first, I felt like they must “actually” look like that on this strange planet. However, another reveal later in the game defies this idea and highlights that these silhouetted creatures definitely aren’t well thought out in terms of design.\n\nThe puzzles were reasonable; for better or worse, the days of sitting stuck on a tough puzzler for weeks to months without a walkthrough or guide are gone. Mobile does tend to make puzzling a little less robust- the types of puzzles begin to feel a bit repetitive by the end of the game. That said, they did feel well integrated into the world that was crafted.\n\nHowever, the character lines around the puzzles really cheapens the experience. I don’t want to feel like I’m being led around by the nose or that I’m listening to a kid’s TV show. Several times I wondered if this game was directed at kindergarteners because of the tone the astronaut was using. Still, I appreciate that the character is voice acted at all- full V.O.’s can be somewhat rare in the genre.\n\nOur astronaut is also very curious about the planet, but is adamant that she’s getting out of there ASAP. Isn’t she an explorer? well, here’s a chance to explore! More than once we also end up relying on her gut feelings, adding to how contrived the short story line feels.\n\nThe reveal in Act 5 is pretty cool; I didn’t know what to expect about the fate of the planet, but it wasn’t that. Unfortunately, the end of the game really leaves a lot to be desired. Apparently this game connects to something else the developer has done, but it wasn’t clear that you needed that knowledge ahead of time to make the ending feel exciting. It’s also possible that this game will get a sequel, but if it doesn’t, there are so many unanswered questions created by the ending that it feels incredibly unsatisfying. I did not expect to end this game feeling very sad about the outcome for the astronaut and other environments/creatures/etc, but that’s where I’m at.\n\nFinal thing:  the musical sting used in cut scenes is really great! But it gets old fast. A little more variety would have been nice. \n\nOverall okay. I’d add a half star if I could just to support the work that went into all the art, but I just think the story isn’t tight enough to support the experience this game needed to really make a splash.",

But this is a quality of life issue. It doesn’t seem to add anything to the game, there are no extra rewards, just an extra 30 min of tediously beating the same boss, over and over.\n\nWorse if you die right at the end of the last fight, because you’re exhausted and start to phone it in, not because your deck is weak.\n\nThere may be some kind of unlock to put a stop to this, but I haven’t found one.

(and their health scales the same, too). Can't even win by spamming troops because they will get AoE one-shotted, often from range. // It becomes a matter of hoping you get a good attack gear quickly. Get a good gear going with a relatively high speed, and then ... cakewalk. Still may have some leakers though w/o lots of attack gears at a high speed, but the final wave is often defeated by your attack gears before your first troop has even landed on the ground.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "For the most part, I like this game. It is generous with the diamonds. It's good about giving extra energy. I like some of the I guess you would call them mini games like the one where you had to clear snow to find stuff and now it's using the picks to reveal things. I think I like them because of the cat plus they do give some good rewards. A good amount of rewards are available in this game. I like the summer game playing right now where you generate different things than in the main game and eventually get rewards. I especially like that it has its own energy and does not take away from the main game. The clothing/jewelry is now pretty fair giving both. The meat/bread generator has gotten better at giving bread but still does not give it often enough. The orange/milk does not generate enough milk. It is ridiculous that it's after eight or 10 oranges that you will finally get a milk product. However I have hated this about every merge game. I have also hated that every merge games generators put out 2 different types of items. I hate the recharging and always have. Thankfully, on the main machines it's not too bad in this game, it's generally under three minutes, but it's still annoying. Thankfully, the ads that just randomly pop up have reduced from when I started but the ad that I saw that made me download the game said no annoying ads. Ads I choose to watch to get a reward I am fine with. The amount of milk and the amount of bread that come out of the generators needs to increase. The reason this game has not been deleted yet is because I get to play for a while.",

It's been idk how many days that I have not even thought about this game at all. On one of my runs I watch the claw go down and grab a bunch of items and right when it started to come up one of the items I was going for immediately disappeared. When it's the games mechanic I can't get past it. I will never play this game again and wasted the money I spent on it. I hate free to play but this game makes me want to just play free to play so I am not wasting money like this. I am very disappointed. I like this game. It's pretty entertaining. I just bought it today and I am on my first run. I am on floor 16 and just started to notice stuff disappearing. So 2 turns I watched the magnet drop in the machine and immediately disappear. Third turn it drops lands on the other stuff and when I went to grab it, it disappeared. Next stage same floor I watched stuff fall and immediately disappear. The reason such a low rating is grabbing stuff is the whole point of the game. Can't grab stuff if it doesn't drop or show up like it should. Please fix.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I really enjoy this game, the combat and team building is very fun as well as collecting the voidpets themselves. But at a certain point, you’re left at a crossroads between waiting literal days to progress a single floor or reaching into your pockets and buying things from the store. Like say, you run into a boss where your team is at a severe type disadvantage, but you have no Voidpets of a high enough level to fight them, or just flat out don’t have any pets with good typing against the boss. Which leaves you stuck waiting for days to get the required EXP and VM to beat the floor. And you can almost completely forget about getting lucky and hatching something with good typing against the boss. The later in the game you get the stingier they are with eggs, to the point where you’ll be lucky to get 3-5 eggs a week. \n\nPersonally, I think this can be solved by just adding more features that give rewards in the game. Whether that be something like a PVP Arena, or an infinite mode where you fight monsters in waves, there just needs to be more ways to get EXP, VM, and Eggs other than just buying them from the shop.\n\n;TLDR; - You hit a point where your only options are buy things from the in game store or wait literal days to progress a single floor.",

There’s no video and guess what it doesn’t work why not just use a pinch or some type of menu option to release a new ball?
