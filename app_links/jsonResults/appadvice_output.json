I am a huge rogue like fan, started with Dead Cells, and now I have, like, twenty and counting. And when I saw that there seemed to be another one for the collection, I was extremely excited. I downloaded the game and found the beginning very fun, interesting leveling up mechanics, I was into it…\n\n …Until I reached the level cap… \n\n Now, don’t get me wrong, I love a difficult game, but having to, basically, face the same brick wall with a different combination of these 50 levels, just trying to get some progress, having to face the same levels, with the same enemies. Now, I know a rogue like is supposed to be somewhat repetitive at some point in the progression. But this game reached that point, A LOT quicker than other titles I have played. If the developers added some level diversion, like those similar to that of Soul Knight, that would greatly extend the game’s ability to be entertaining for longer. \n\n But, anyway, that all that I have to say about this game, the general game mechanics are nice, but the same levels and the same enemies without any diversion can get dull very quickly.",

I read everything over and I was excited to accept your offer and then try things out (sleep issues seem to be somewhat of a constant for me since I reached adulthood). I followed the link, completed the download of your app and then I began the onboarding process (all pretty standard fair when accepting this sort of an offer through App Advice. Of which, I’ve been doing for close to ten years now). However, something wasn’t working the way I assumed it ought to when trying to accept your offer today. When I reached  the screen suggesting I upgrade to the premium version of Moonlight : Sleep & Sounds, that was where I encountered the issue. Your offer was for a free lifetime subscription to your apps premium features, yet I was seeing all options priced normally. Generally, the lifetime option will show a price of $0.00 for you to select and “purchase” in the App Store when accepting these type of lifetime subscription offers through App Advice. I don’t feel comfortable going any further with the process with the lifetime subscription showing the full $29.99 price as that isn’t how this normally works. And if I end up being charged the full price, I know that trying to get an app developer to issue you a refund, regardless of the issue you experienced, that shi…. just isn’t happening, you know? I went back onto App Advice and the offer had not yet expired, so that shouldn’t be the issue, I don’t think. \n\n    How ‘bout a little help here aye? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn’t mind extending yourself and maybe helpin’ a brotha on this one. Is there someone I could message about this to see about getting  some help with this matter? Of course, I will straight away go and fix this rating and review after receiving y’all’s help on this issue. But yeah, I really hope to hear back from you about this issue I had and I look forward to trying out your new sleep app. Thanks guys! 🤝🏼\n\nCraig",

Sure, you can start up the app and choose Now Playing and see a pretty cool view of the song that is now playing. But when the song changes, this app doesn’t seem to be aware that a different song is “now playing.” You have to terminate this app and restart it so that the currently playing song is shown onscreen. I know this can’t be the intended design so is this maybe a bug? Whatever it is I hope it’s fixed right quick because the app in its current state is useless. \n\nIncidentally this issue is present for every device I’ve tried so far, from iPhone to iPad to Apple TV.",

If there are no sessions, it should at least categorize each task type together (or there should be an option for this). This app has nothing!

At least when i came into this i already knew the alphabet because i’m using this to supplement my duolingo lessons as well.

They also provide exercises to match Spanish words with mental associations and even AI pronunciation practice. All this is extremely helpful.\n  The problem is that the app rarely updates. It seems to me that the developers expected to launch Palteca and use the revenue from the rather pricey app to support a full-time staff. When the cash didn’t flow in, the creative enthusiasm dried up, leaving the paying customers stranded.\n  I sincerely had high hopes for Palteca.

I have opened and selected the data but it resumes to load.\n\nUpdate - Deleted another star as developers refuse to help me fix the restore problem that still doe not work.\n\nUpdate - 02/07/25 - Still unable to get the backup from my iPhone 14  to uninstall on my iPad mini.\nYour questions\n\n1. The exact model of your device and the iOS version you are using. iPhone -iPhone 14 (IOS 18.3) iPad mini. (iOS 18.3)\n2. The file extension and file name of the backup you created. When I creat it, I save it to notes per you link and it says BearKeyboard (Feb 7, 2025,\n19/41) .wordlightDB\n3. If possible, screenshots or a short video showing the crash when it occurs. I never said it crashed. I said it DOES NOT LOAD the backup. When I click on the file and it says share as per your instructions, I DO NOT see Bear in does not show up in the list of files.",

Do you want reviews from people who have actually used your product, with genuine feedback about your product?  You doing this as a company builds distrust and a lack of confidence in your product. The actual product seems pretty good, as long as the in-app purchase remains a reasonable price. A little iffy about what the permissions are and whether they apply on to the free version, and the lifetime version too, especially given review-begging practices.

First off– the logo is dreadful. \n\nSecond, please make a real iPad app. I have no intention of using my phone when I’m sitting down at home planning meals based on what I already have. \n\nThird– provide an easy-access print-ready display option. I store my recipes on Zotero and don’t want to have to do fiddly photo stitching to get an image I can attach to my files. \n\nFourth— the second recipe I found was missing crucial information. The first step was to prepare the caramelized nuts, and from the way it was set up, I was to add every ingredient to the nuts, including lettuce, cheese, oil, water, etc. Luckily, I found out I could click on the author's name and go to her site to find out what she really meant. \n\nFifth— this is a pie-in-the-sky wish. People don't seem to understand how to compose recipes, and I'd love to see this app or any other provide tutorials. Recipes have traditionally been written with a standard and succinct vocabulary, but, oh my! The things I see online! In the aforementioned recipe, I was instructed to “make the nuts” rather than “prepare” the nuts. I suppose it sounds unimportant to anyone who has found most of their recipes online, but it irritates me. There are so many annoying extras- who needs to be told the first part is the “ingredients “ and the second is “how to make,” “instructions for cooking,” and the many dozens of other ways to clutter things up. The individual steps have just as much excess verbiage. I’ve been cooking since I was about 9 or 10 years old and am old enough to remember Nixon’s resignation and his election. I don't need or want excess stuff in my recipes, so I too often need to rewrite them to make sense. Maybe authors should provide the recipes the way they like them and the traditional, streamlined versions.",

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I left this review based on my honest experience with the app. If you consider feedback or refund requests to be “shady” or “suspicious,” that’s unfortunate. My mention of an Amazon gift card was simply sharing an experience I had with another developer. After Apple denied my refund, they kindly offered an alternative refund through PayPal. When PayPal wasn’t an option for me, they suggested a gift card as a goodwill gesture. This was an empathetic response, not something suspicious.\n\nRegarding the purchase, my son accidentally made it. Initially, I thought the app seemed useful, but after further use, I realized it didn’t meet my needs. Had it been more effective, I would have gladly kept it. Instead of addressing my feedback, you ignored my last two emails and chose to publicly respond to my review in a way that felt like an attack.\n\nTo clarify, I never requested a gift card. I was simply sharing a past experience with another developer. Apple likely denied my refund because the app offers a free trial, and they may have assumed I had the opportunity to test it beforehand or could have prevented an accidental purchase with my child.\n\nThe app itself has clear limitations. While marketed as a habit tracker for weight, photos, water intake, and books read:\n1.Only the weight and photo features actually track progress.\n2.Water intake and books read are merely checklist items with no meaningful tracking functionality, such as visual charts or progress records like the weight and photo features offer. Setting a daily target doesn’t provide a visual tracking chart or record, so it’s not truly a tracker.\n3.The app only allows setting general reminders at specific times, but there are no personalized reminders for individual tasks, making the task management feature impractical.\n4.The only customization offered for tasks is the ability to change their icon colors, which adds no real functionality beyond aesthetics.\n\nIn reality, the app functions more like a to-do list with a photo and weight tracker—nothing more—at a price of $5.99.\n\nIt’s important to note that you were the one who publicly exposed this situation, not me. You falsely claimed that I requested a gift card, which I did not. In my emails, I raised concerns about the app’s missing features and requested specific improvements multiple times, none of which you addressed.\n\nHad Apple refunded me, I wouldn’t have contacted you at all. Instead of considering users’ explanations, you assume the worst and dismiss legitimate concerns. Furthermore, handling this issue publicly on the App Store rather than privately is unprofessional.\n\nI don’t understand the point of telling me you won’t engage further via email while continuing to publicly attack me on the App Store. If you truly had no interest in further discussion, you wouldn’t be responding at all—especially not in a public forum. It seems that rather than resolving issues, you are more interested in discrediting users publicly.\n\nAlso, I find it strange that Apple keeps publishing my review, only for it to mysteriously disappear later. That seems highly suspicious.\n\nI don’t owe you an explanation for my son’s accidental purchase. That was something I addressed in my appeal to Apple, not to you. It’s clear that instead of addressing real concerns, you’re more focused on publicly attacking users.\n\nIf you continue this behavior, I won’t engage further. You can keep the one-star review, but your public responses are unprofessional. I won’t reply anymore—it’s evident you prefer public confrontation over resolving issues privately.",

I can try to upgrade to pro, but the plans never load. You have to guess which plan you are tapping on, and then the one that comes up as Lifetime shows no price, so if you proceed, will it be free, or are you going to get charged $99?

I would never recommend this game to anybody.. the app is purposely designed to immediately CRASH upon a fast time and most likely win especially whenever you wage more than 2 credits. It eats up your wager plus your winnings so it’s impossible to maintain credit balance by design because it crashes a good 40% of games. That or a “Uh oh! Doesn't look like that worked.\nYou have less than an hour to submit your score. Retry when you are connected to the internet”. message, which doesn’t do anything when you tap on NEXT even though you know your Wi-Fi connection is solid and fast so you are forced to quit the app and restart it. (If it doesn’t crash, then it’s this issue - about 70% of the time!)\nThen when you restart the app, the last game isn’t recorded. A quality app does not waste the user's time. It is not a continuous money grab that preys on people who don't understand that by nature it is designed to take and take and never give. I sincerely hope gambling addicts who buy credits steer clear of this nonsense, because it is purely a money grab designed to take advantage of players.",

After download, the only available promo is $.99 for first month, $4.99/mo thereafter. Further, the dev promotes an annual subscription for $49 as 50% off. If $4.99 is the standard monthly price, how is $49/yr equal to 50% off. These are signs of manipulative marketing tactics. \n\nDevs who employ these tactics often promise access to the most advanced AI models for low cost. In actuality they’re providing access to a low-cost version of  GPT3/3.5, sometimes fine tuned to evade questions about the exact model version. Dishonest devs using these manipulative tactics to maximize their profits is all too common. These devs should not be trusted with your money nor your data… avoid them. You’re far better off using the free versions of ChatGPT, Perplexity or other reputable solutions. \n\nThat said, people make mistakes. If the above points were simply mistakes that the dev rectifies, I will amend my rating/review.\n\nResponse to dev: \nNew app promos on AppAdvice launch daily at 10:30am CST. I downloaded and attempted to take advantage of the offer within an hour of the promo launching on AppAdvice. Further, time-limited and limited seats, are not the same. ALL promotions are time-limited by definition. The promo on AppAdvice says nothing about limited seats (eg: “offer limited to first 1,000 users”). Further, promos on AppAdvice state, ***THIS PROMOTION IS EXPIRED*** once the offer expires, usually 12-24hrs after launch. AppAdvice still shows your promo active three days after it launched. Why are you still promoting the offer if it expired within a few hours of launch??\n\nRegarding the price/discount % discrepancy… you might want to use your own app to ask GPT to help you correctly frame promo/discount language. This is entry level stuff, and based on the scathing reviews and your responses, MarComm is not a strength.\n\nAgain, these are tactics frequently used by dishonest devs… honest devs generally take the long view, going over and above to take responsibility and make it right.

    "LastNegativeRatingText": "I got this app after seeing it mentioned in App Advice. I was really annoyed by the onboarding process and then having to review the app before I could use it. Not the smartest way to have your customers start off…annoyed. The app is very simply laid out, but a few things are confusing. Some of the contrasts in colors need to be more pronounced so people with vision problems can see. The calculated unit dosing on the syringe should have more contrast from the syringe tick marks. The label under the syringe on the right, “vial contains X doses” is VERY confusing. It implies the calculated results, given the water and peptide strength input, will give you a glass vial sitting on the counter with X (in my case 100) doses. That is totally not correct given my input of .5 mL Bac Water and .5 mL of 10 mg Tirz. So, I think the dev is trying to emphasize the syringe has 100 potential doses based on the number of tick marks on it? But, that is not necessary and is just plain confusing. Plus, the wording in that location is just more visual clutter since it is not useful information pertaining to the calculation just completed. Also, the last input you make, the peptide dose you want, should have the option for mcg OR mg. For example, for Tirzepatide, I will use mg. It is unlikely I will ever go lower than mg strength, even microdosing it. But for Sema or Reta, I will definitely use mcg. So, being able to choose would be nice, instead of having to do the math myself before plugging in the numbers. As far as what I like? I LOVE that you can save your calculations in a history for quick and easy reference. It is nice to have this information available to pull up quickly. It would be great to have an information library on various peptides and what they all do. I am not sure if the dev has that kind of time though. Nice job in general!",

I don’t need to use the app to respond to YOUR privacy policy even if matters no longer apply. Thank you.\n\nDoes OpenAI delete personal messages? Deletion doesn’t count as data collection, but processing data through your app or services does. The data usage issue persists. Other companies use the App Store’s “usage data” marker, but this developer avoids mentioning it. Data collection is data collection, and the anonymity of the usage data remains unmentioned. \n\nTransparency surpasses data collection for me. Apple offers transparency, but companies overlook it due to the absence of “personal data.” Your in-app AI, regardless of processing or deletion, constitutes data collection, even if brief and self-resolving.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious review:\n\nPrivacy policy doesn’t align with the App Store’s guidelines: no data collection. It saves conversations with AI and collects “usage data.” Both can be displayed in the App Store as “data not linked to you.” I’d like to review other exceptional companies’ privacy policies, but I’m starting to understand the loophole. I’ll continue to provide 1-star reviews until these companies rectify their issues. It’s similar to Yelp: you can’t delete or purchase honest reviews. Therefore, this 1-star rating will remain.
